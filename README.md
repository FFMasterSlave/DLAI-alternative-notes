# DLAI-alternative-notes
This repository contains the slides for the 2023 course of Deep Learning and Applied Artificial Intelligence of Professor Emanuele Rodolà at Sapienza university of Rome.

I have added to them my notes taken during the course, along with some additional insights, but always related to the topics explained by the professor.

I thought it could be useful for future students of this exceptional course to have some reference material on the theoretical part.

Consider these slides as a form of support for the course.

IMPORTANT: These are some key informations to take into consideration:
- these are student notes made for students, so there may be errors. If in doubt, ask Professor Rodolà, who will surely be able to provide the correct answers.
- the notes are in Italian (sorry). If i see some kind of interest in this work, i may take into consideration to translate them in English.
- the notes were taken using [Foxit PDF Editor](https://www.foxit.com/it/pdf-reader/) vesrion 2023.2.0.21408, but they should be viewable with other PDF readers as well.
